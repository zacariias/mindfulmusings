<div class="section">
<h1>Musing</h1>
<p>To wonder<br />and ponder</p>
<p>To clarify<br />and understand</p>
<p>To relate<br />and connect</p>
<p>To be present<br />and describe</p>
<p>To be grounded<br />and certain</p>
<p>To let anxiety<br />exist and float</p>
<p>To be uncertain<br />and unclear</p>
<p>To share<br />and comfort</p>
<p>To accept<br />and join</p>
<p>To contemplate<br />the great mystery</p>
</div>

<div id="section-2"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>The Great Mystery</h1>
<p>The great mystery<br />is in the universe</p>
<p>It is all round us and<br />in the air we breath</p>
<p>The great mystery is in<br />the wind and the earth</p>
<p>We are compelled<br />and directed by it</p>
<p>We are of the great mystery<br />as it is our being</p>
<p>We are free to ponder it<br />or be ignorant of it</p>
<p>The great mystery is the<br />question and the answer</p>
<p>It has no limits and<br />cannot be measured</p>
<p>The great mystery is<br />the means and the end</p>
<p>It is unsolvable yet<br />it may be understood</p>
<p>We live the great mystery<br />as it is us</p>
</div>

<div id="section-3"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Empty Moments</h1>
<p>without self<br />or envy</p>
<p>unattached<br />to outcome</p>
<p>present<br />in the moment</p>
<p>mindful<br />of assumptions</p>
<p>at peace<br />with what is</p>
<p>grounded<br />and still</p>
<p>drifting<br />in bliss</p>
</div>

<div id="section-4"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>God</h1>
<p>god is the stillness<br />behind confusion</p>
<p>the silence<br />behind sound</p>
<p>the resolve<br />behind uncertainty</p>
<p>and the grace<br />behind ignorance</p>
<p>we choose to distance<br />ourselves from god<br />but we cannot escape</p>
<p>bliss is a choice<br />we make in each moment</p>
<p>god is the bliss<br />behind our pain</p>
</div>

<div id="section-5"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Nothingness</h1>
<p>The value of nothingness is unapparent<br />yet the source of meaning of everything</p>
<p>Our capacity to understand emptiness<br />places our lives in perspective</p>
<p>Unable to touch nothing clutters our minds<br />and everything seems more important</p>
<p>It is the place where there is nothing which<br />makes the window and the vessel useful</p>
<p>Unless we touch being centered we<br />can only be confused by everything</p>
<p>Being centered on nothing grounds us in<br />reality and clarifies our minds muddy water</p>
<p>Being uncentered our passions run away<br />with our minds and enslaves our decisions</p>
<p>Tethered to nothingness we can seek balance<br />with our hearts our minds and our souls</p>
<p>Adrift in everything we bob like<br />corks in a vast sea of daily choices</p>
<p>The gift of nothingness is available being<br />present in the moment and following our breath</p>
</div>

<div id="section-6"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Nothingness II</h1>
<p>Nothingness has existed<br />prior to the beginning of life</p>
<p>And to nothingness is<br />where all of life returns</p>
<p>There are countless beings and civilizations<br />swallowed up by nothingness</p>
<p>And there is no one alive with any<br />direct awareness of their existence</p>
<p>In spite of all we deem important<br />all these things will fade away</p>
<p>Nothingness is the emptiness of our being<br />and can be a source of great anguish</p>
<p>It is however a vital source of understanding<br />the essence of our existence</p>
<p>Without this grounding we can develop an<br />exaggerated sense of our own importance</p>
<p>We can come to believe that our<br />experiences are most important</p>
<p>When in fact we too in due time<br />shall disappear into nothingness</p>
</div>

<div id="section-7"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Uncarved Block</h1>
<p>Life is eternal but has no name<br />The uncarved block<br />though seemly of small account<br />is greater than anything under heaven</p>
<p>If people would possess<br />themselves of it<br />creatures would flock<br />to do them homage</p>
<p>Heaven and earth would conspire<br />to sent sweet dew and<br />without law or compulsion<br />people would dwell in harmony</p>
<p>Once the block is carved<br />there will be names and<br />soon as there are names<br />know that it is time to stop</p>
<p>Only by knowing<br />when it is time<br />to stop can<br />danger be avoided</p>
<p>To life all<br />under heaven will come<br />as steams and torrents flow<br />into a great river or sea</p>
</div>

<div id="section-8"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Fog of Anxiety</h1>
<p>Floating in so quietly<br />disguised as something benign</p>
<p>Its pressure ever present and<br />growing over with ease</p>
<p>Bathed in the fog<br />all is distorted and danger lurks</p>
<p>Ever present it is soon all there is<br />nothing else permeates</p>
<p>Removed from the fog by a miracle<br />is faint joy when stepping back in the fog</p>
<p>I have found the source of my pain<br />and it is me</p>
<p>The fog of anxiety is my lurking about<br />in my self imposed dogma</p>
<p>I can see my way out of the fog<br />just as clearly as I see myself</p>
<p>When I see myself I see compassion,<br />god's love and most certain grace</p>
<p>God's most certain love and grace<br />Love and grace</p>
</div>

<div id="section-9"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>The Way</h1>
<p>Sharing without expecting</p>
<p>Loving without desiring</p>
<p>Believing without anticipating</p>
<p>Trusting without depending</p>
<p>Finding without influencing</p>
<p>Listening without interpreting</p>
<p>Accepting without construing</p>
<p>Looking without judging</p>
<p>Living without suffering</p>
</div>

<div id="section-10"></div>

<div class="section">
<h1>The Self So</h1>
<p>The self so is of its own accord<br />and whatever is is</p>
<p>The self so was here long before us<br />and will be here long after</p>
<p>What we say about the self so is<br />usually correct until we discover it's not</p>
<p>The self so is in all living beings and<br />in all existence throughout time</p>
<p>The self so is present in every<br />moment and has no lust of outcome</p>
<p>Our consciousness is our access to<br />comprehending the self so</p>
<p>The self so is available by being<br />descriptive present and discerning</p>
<p>The self so exists outside our being<br />yet it includes us as well</p>
<p>Our struggle with our consciousness is our<br />struggle in being present with the self so</p>
<p>The self so is available in every breath<br />thought and choice we make</p>
<p>Friends and the self so leave us as they<br />find us and are free from interpretation</p>
<p>The self so makes apparent gods love<br />Gods love is self so</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h1>Everything is exactly what it is</h1>
<p>Why do we attach meaning to things and experiences?</p>
<p>Why do we look for people who will "complete" us?</p>
<p>Jobs that will give our lives meaning and purpose?</p>
<p>Why do we assume this is possible at all&mdash;</p>
<p>that happiness or fulfillment is something that can come from outside of us?</p>
<p>Perhaps to avoid the much more difficult truth that these things must come from within.</p>
<p>Everything is exactly what it is, no more, no less.</p>
<p>The meaning and purpose we attach to things is an indication of what we seek inside ourselves.</p>
